CREDIT RISK ANALYSIS

Perform a detailed analysis of a dataset that includes diverse financial and demographic information
about loan applicants. Our objective is to identify the factors that impact loan default rates and to
devise strategies to reduce lending risks.

Objectives:

Importing necessary Libraries/Modules

Loading dataset

Task 1 - Exploring the Dataset:

● Understand the Structure and various datatypes of the attributes within the dataset.

Task 2 - Missing value analysis:

● Identify and analyze missing values in the dataset.

Task 3 - Analyzing categorical and numerical columns:

● Analyze categorical and numerical columns to understand the statistical properties and
relationships within the dataset.

Task 4 - Univariate Analysis:

● Conduct univariate analysis to explore the distribution and characteristics of individual
variables.

Task 5 - Outliers:

● Identify and analyze outliers within the dataset to understand their impact on the analysis.

Task 6 - Merging Datasets:

● Identify and merge different Datasets for further analysis.

Task 7 - Bivariate analysis/Multivariate Analysis

● Conduct bivariate analysis to explore relationships between different variables and their
impact on loan default rates.

SUMMARY

Throughout this practice session, we conducted a series of tasks that yielded valuable insights into the
loan applicant dataset. We effectively identified missing values, explored variable distributions, analyzed
outliers, and examined relationships among different attributes.
This analysis establishes a foundational understanding of the dataset and its implications for loan
management and risk assessment. These insights can inform decision-making processes moving
forward, such as the development of predictive models or refinement of loan approval criteria, ultimately
enhancing lending practices and reducing default risk
